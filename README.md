# REVISIT JS

> Week 13 with SheCodes

> Let's have fun with some Javascript exercices

**Exercice 1**
Create a web page that displays a number and two buttons. One button decrements the number by 1, the other button increments the number by 1.

**Exercice 2**
Create a web page that lists a few different items and their prices. The user should be able to add each of these items to their cart.

**Exercise 3**
Create a web page for one of the following:
- Whack-a-Mole.
- Rock-Paper-Scissors
- Meme generator (see https://imgflip.com/memegenerator for inspiration).
- Flash Cards.

**Exercise 4**
Recreate the Snake Game! This one will be a bit more challenging so only tackle it if you feel comfortable in
JavaScript and algorithms. If that isnâ€™t you, then head back to exercise three and pick another idea to create.
